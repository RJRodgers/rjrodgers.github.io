In the Autumn of 2024, [Adrien Bouhon](https://nordita.org/people/nordita-person/adrien-bouhon) and I gave a lecture course on Group Theory and Topology in Physics, for theoretical physics Master's students at Stockholm University. Here are (slightly expanded) lecture notes covering the group theory part of the course:

Please let me know if you find any mistakes. The notes are split into two parts:

- The first part provides and introduction to finite groups and their representations, with an application to symmetric groups.
- The second part covers matrix Lie groups, Lie algebras, and the representations of simple Lie algebras, using su(2) and su(3) as examples. The Wigner Eckart theorem for su(2) is derived and applied to simple examples in quantum mechanics. We also sketch the application of su(3) to particle physics in the form of the [Eightfold Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_way_(physics))
