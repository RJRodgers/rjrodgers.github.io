Test paragraph.

I am Ronnie Rodgers, a theoretical physicist working as a postdoc at [Nordita](https://nordita.org/), the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics, in Stockholm. On this website you can find information about my research and teaching activities. If you'd like to know more, you can contact me at ronnie.rodgers@su.se.

 I work on various aspects of [holography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), the idea that gravity can be described by physics in lower dimensions, similar to how a hologram encodes a 3D image on a 2D surface. My research is funded by the European Union through a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions postdoctoral fellowship, [which you can read about here](HATS.md).
