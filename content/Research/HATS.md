HATS stands for *Holography and Topological Semimetals*, and is the name of my Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions postdoctoral fellowship. All of my research since September 2023 has been funded by the European Union through this fellowship.

On this page I describe the background and motivation for this research project. You can find more technical information on [CORDIS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101104286), the EU's website for research results.

### Quantum Field Theory

[Quantum Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) (QFT) is a framework used in particle physics and condensed matter physics (the physics of materials). Different QFTs are used to describe different physical objects and systems. For example, [the standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) is the QFT used to in particle physics to describe how elementary particles interact with each other. In condensed matter physics, different materials are described by different QFTs.
### Weyl semimetals

Semimetals are materials with properties somewhere in between those of metals and semiconductors. They conduct electricity, but only weakly. [Weyl semimetals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_semimetal) are a new class of semimetals that were experimentally discovered in 2015.
### Holography

Holography, also known as the [AdS/CFT correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence), relates different physical theories. It says that certain theories of gravity in are equivalent to certain theories
